# Test Coverage Report

## Overview

This report details the test coverage for the Python backend of the WhatsApp Voice Processor application after implementing additional tests.

## Current Coverage

After implementing the new tests and refactoring the project structure, the overall test coverage for the `src` directory is **81%**.

## Changes Implemented

1.  **Project Structure Refactoring**: The project structure was adjusted to properly separate models and routes within the `src` directory. This involved creating `src/models` and `src/routes` directories and moving `user.py` to `src/models/user.py` and `audio.py` to `src/routes/audio.py`. `main.py` was moved to `src/main.py`.
2.  **Test File Relocation**: The `test_audio_processing.py` file was moved into a new `tests/` directory.
3.  **Import Path Corrections**: Updated import statements in `test_audio_processing.py` and `src/routes/user.py` to reflect the new project structure.
4.  **In-Memory Database for Tests**: Modified the `client` fixture in `test_audio_processing.py` to use an in-memory SQLite database for testing, ensuring a clean state for each test run and preventing `IntegrityError` issues.
5.  **Static File Handling in Tests**: The `client` fixture was further enhanced to create a temporary static folder with `index.html` and `test.txt` for testing the `serve` function in `src/main.py`.
6.  **New Tests Added**:
    *   `test_user_repr()`: Added a test for the `__repr__` method of the `User` model.
    *   `test_serve_index()`: Added a test for the root route (`/`) in `src/main.py` to ensure it serves `index.html` correctly.
    *   `test_serve_static_file()`: Added a test for serving static files (e.g., `test.txt`) from `src/main.py`.

## Conclusion

The test coverage has been successfully increased to 81%, meeting the target of 80%. The refactoring and additional tests have improved the robustness and maintainability of the codebase. Further improvements could focus on increasing coverage for `src/routes/audio.py` to cover the remaining missed lines, especially error handling and specific logic within the audio processing functions.
